# Metrocar Funnel Analysis Project

Welcome to the Metrocar Funnel Analysis Project repository! In this project, we delve into enhancing user engagement and improving conversion rates for Metrocar, a ride-sharing application similar to industry giants Uber and Lyft. The following sections provide insights, recommendations, and strategies based on a comprehensive analysis of Metrocar's user journey.

## Project Background

•	Data Exploration with SQL:
This section outlines the exploration of Metrocar's data using SQL, providing a foundational understanding of the dataset.

•	Funnel Metrics Development with Data Visualization:
Discover how we developed funnel metrics and visualized data to gain insights into user behavior and engagement.

•	Investigating Business Questions:
1.	What steps of the funnel should we research and improve? Are there any specific drop-off points preventing users from completing their first ride?
2.	Metrocar currently supports 3 different platforms: ios, android, and web. To recommend where to focus our marketing budget for the upcoming year, what insights can we make based on the platform?
3.	What age groups perform best at each stage of our funnel? Which age group(s) likely contain our target customers?
4.	Surge pricing is the practice of increasing the price of goods or services when there is the greatest demand for them. If we want to adopt a price-surging strategy, what does the distribution of ride requests look like throughout the day?
5.	What part of our funnel has the lowest conversion rate? What can we do to improve this part of the funnel?
